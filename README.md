In this project I will be creating a web page using basic html 
practices

I will be practicing writing basic html boilerplate,
adding images, and creating links, headings, and paragraphs. 

I will also focus on making micro-commits so that in future work I 
will be in the habit of making commits any time I make a meaningful
change to the code.
